# Weather Report

## Goal

"Do I need to bring a jacket?" "Will it snow today?" "How hot will it be?" When we have questions like these, we often pull open a weather app!

The goal is to create a fun, small weather app that focuses on displaying the weather.

The weather app will set the weather using user interaction and get the weather from a 3rd party API, OpenWeather.
